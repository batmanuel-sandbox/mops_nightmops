In order to generate some test data

1. Execute lsst_root/cat/trunk/sql/lsstSchema4mysqlDC3b.sql 
   (copied here for convenience).
2. Generate the test data SQL by using the psmops_to_daymops.py script.
3. Execute the test data SQL script generated in the step above.

This will create the necessary database schema and populate it with a full 
lunation of DIASources over a simple cadence. It will also contain a small
(1/1000) subset of the full Solar System Model.

The test data assumes Science_CCD_Exposure of 7 square degrees with a single
Science_Amp_Exposure of the same size.

The test data was generated by using PS-MOPS over the May 2008 TAO survey using
PS specific configuration and then massaged to fit the LSST schema.

The test database is called daymops_onelunation
