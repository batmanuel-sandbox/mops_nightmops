Introduction
There are two types of test data. On one hand there is data used to test runs of
LSST-MOPS. This is data that was generated using PS-MOPS on a small, one 
lunation, low density simulation.

Then there is data for the unit tests. This data comes in part from a subset of
the data described above and in part from totally random data.



LSST-MOPS Test Data
In order to generate some test data

1. Execute lsst_root/cat/trunk/sql/lsstSchema4mysqlDC3b.sql 
   (copied here for convenience).
2. Generate the test data SQL by using the psmops_to_daymops.py script.
3. Execute the test data SQL script generated in the step above.

This will create the necessary database schema and populate it with a full 
lunation of DIASources over a simple cadence. It will also contain a small
(1/1000) subset of the full Solar System Model.

The test data assumes Science_CCD_Exposure of 7 square degrees with a single
Science_Amp_Exposure of the same size.

The test data was generated by using PS-MOPS over the May 2008 TAO survey using
PS specific configuration and then massaged to fit the LSST schema.

The test database is called daymops_onelunation



Unit-test Test Data
This data comes already packaged in the form of (My)SQL dumps.

Full dump of DIASource table from mops_onelunation dataset: 
    mops_onelunation_DIASource.sql

Full dump of DIASourceIDTonight from mops_onelunation dataset for night number 
54591:
    mops_onelunation_DIASourceIDTonight.sql

Subset of 1000 random rows from the MovingObject table from the mops_onelunation
dataset. Random MovingObject -> mops_Tracklet linkings (each movingObjectId is
associated to between 0 and 10 random trackletIds):
    mops_onelunation_MovingObject.sql

Full dump of mops_Tracklet and mops_TrackletsToDIASource from the 
mops_onelunation dataset:
    mops_onelunation_mops_Tracklet.sql

Random mops_Track -> mops_Tracklet linkings (each trackId is associated to 
between 0 and 10 random trackletIds):
    mops_onelunation_mops_TracksToTracklet.sql
