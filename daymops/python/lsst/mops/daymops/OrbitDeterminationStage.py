BASIC COURSE
System gets
1. a list of clusters of trackletIds, one cluster per Track
as input.

A. System invokes "Orbit Determination" on the Tracklets from step A.

B. System flags the Tracklets from step B. as LINKED.

C. System flags the new MovingObjects from step B. as NEW.



Policy
  2. OrbitDetermination config
  3. MPC observatory OBSCODE
  4. Database name and location

Input
  1. a list of clusters of trackletIds, one cluster per Track

Output
  1. None/error code?
